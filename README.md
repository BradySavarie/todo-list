This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed to help strengthen my object oriented programming skills and improve my ability to write modular Javascript. I used Tailwind to style this project and decided to restrict the design to mobile rather than make it fully-responsive so I could keep my focus on learning Javascript rather than the UI. The main challenges I faced were learning how to build and debug modularized code, implement local storage, and design with a mobile-first approach using utility-classes.

<h3>Built With:</h3>
