This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed to help strengthen my object oriented programming skills and improve my ability to write modular Javascript. I used Tailwind to style this project so I could get more practice designing for mobile screen resolutions. I decided not to spend time making this app fully-responsive as I was mainly concerned with practicing my Javascript, however I may take the opportunity to revisit it in the future as a way to practice implementing dynamic user-interfaces.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Building this todo list helped alot with my understanding of using Webpack to write and bundle modular code. I feel alot more confident in my ability to debug a bundled file (which was a big hang up on my last project) and make decisions regarding how to best split my code up into manageable chunks. I was able to practice the SOLID principles while designing this app and even came across a few useful topics such as the CRUD and MVC methods of organizing code. The concepts of local storage and using external libraries such as date-fns are also demystified now which i'm sure will come in handy for future projects. I also had the chance to get some good practice in on designing for mobile, specifically using Tailwind utility classes.

<h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>

Perhaps a better way of approaching this project would have been focusing less on the UI design right from the start. I ended up deciding not to worry about responsivity by the end of this project because I found myself spending alot of time tweaking styles regardless of whether or not it was helping accomplish my primary goal of improving my Javascript ability. I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to visuals so I think building this app taught me that I need to learn to pick my battles and focus my attention on the things that have the biggest impact on whatever the current goal is.
