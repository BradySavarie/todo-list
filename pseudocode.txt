    Projects Page (set to default) lists all projects
    Tasks Page lists all tasks

    Task View lists all contents of the selected task
        - Tasks can be updated and deleted here
      
    
    Things to do:

    General:

        - Make nav bar switch between projects page and tasks page

    Projects Page

        - Make project card content dynamically generated from project object
            - Card defaults to rendering an "empty" message with project title, and then replaces content with tasks once they are added to project.
        - Make each project card not expand in width as their text content increases. Title should wrap and task info should not wrap and be hidden on overflow, with a vertical scroll when extra space is needed.
        - When tasks are added to project card, ensure they are styled with a strikethrough when marked as complete
    
    Tasks Page:




    
        - Make a project view that displays all project information when a card is clicked
        - A project can be deleted or updated via the project view
        - Should be able to add a task to the active project in task view
        - Each task can be marked as completed and be deleted
        - Make the footer icons switchable between the home page that lists all projects and the tasks page that lists all tasks
        - make the app responsive
