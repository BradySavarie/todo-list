    Things to do:

    Projects Page

        - Make project card content dynamically generated from project object
            - Card defaults to rendering an "empty" message with project title, and then replaces content with tasks once they are added to project.
        - Make each project card not expand in width as their text content increases. Title should wrap and task info should not wrap and be hidden on overflow, with a vertical scroll when extra space is needed.
        - When tasks are added to project card, ensure they are styled with a strikethrough when marked as complete
        - If default task is deleted, show empty message on projects page

    Project View

     - List all information and tasks associated with selected project
     - Make each field editable and add an update button
     - Create a delete button that deletes the project and its contents (no confirmation modal necessary)
    
    Tasks Page

        - When new tasks are created, append them to a selected project
        - Create and style the section that holds each task
    
    Task View

    - List all information associated with selected task
    - Make each field editable and add an update button
    - Create a delete task button
