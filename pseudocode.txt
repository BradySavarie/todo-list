app.js will setup the default state of the todo-list application.

The projects.js and tasks.js modules will create, read, update, and delete objects. 

A module called handlers.js will retrieve, validate, and export user input

a module called UI.js will update the DOM and render output

Next steps:

- Make read, update, and delete functions
- Setup app.js default logic state
- Ensure all logic is functional
- Write default HTML
- Setup handlers.js to retrieve and distribute input
- Get UI.js to update and render DOM
