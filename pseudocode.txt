    Things to do:

    Projects Page

        - Card defaults to rendering an "empty" message with project title, and then replaces content with tasks once they are added to project.
        - Create a delete button that deletes the project and its contents (no confirmation modal necessary)
        - If default task is deleted, show empty message on projects page
        - Validate form info so no empty inputs can be submitted
        - Add priority and due date information to the tasks on each project card
        - restyle project cards to match task page
        - Make the page responsive
    
    Tasks Page

        - Add mark as complete functionality to each task
        - Create the update task modal and make it functional
        - Make tasks deletable

    - Add local storage to project
    - Consider reformatting displayed dates on cards using date-fns
    - Maybe add in some sort of filtering functionality to learn how that's done
