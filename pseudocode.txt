app.js will setup the default state of the todo-list application.

The projects.js and tasks.js modules will create, read, update, and delete objects. 

A module called handlers.js will retrieve, validate, and export user input

a module called UI.js will update the DOM and render output

Next steps:

Onload:
    - Default project is created
    - Default task is inserted into default project
    - Default styling is rendered

** Use a switch statement to check for data attributes in handlers.js **

Click Events:

    enterNewProjectBtn
        - newProjectModal is displayed and contains a form to retrieve input

        createNewProjectBtn
            - createProject is called with user info as input
            - new empty project is displayed in main container and is set to the current selection

    readProjectBtn
        - readProjectModal is displayed and contains a form that is pre-filled with current project information and accepts edits
        
        updateProjectBtn
            - Change information within currently selected project to the users input
            - Render updated project to main container

    deleteProjectBtn
        - Currently selected project is removed from array
        - if projectsList.length === 0 display no projects message, else set the first project in array to the current selection and display contents

    enterNewTaskBtn
        - newTaskModal is displayed and contains a form to retrieve input

        createNewTaskBtn
            - createTask is called with user info as input and the projectIndex set to the currently selected project
            - new task is displayed in main container

    
    Okay! Main things that I need to do:
        - Style add project modal
        - Make project card content dynamically generated from project object
        - Make a project view that displays all project information when a card is clicked
        - A project can be deleted or updated via the project view
        - Should be able to add a task to the active project in task view
        - Each task can be marked as completed and be deleted
        - Make the footer icons switchable between the home page that lists all projects and the tasks page that lists all tasks
        - make the app responsive
