    Things to do:

    Projects Page

        - Create a delete button that deletes the project and its contents (no confirmation modal necessary)
    
    Tasks Page

        - Add mark as complete functionality to each task
        - Create the update task modal and make it functional
        - Make tasks deletable

    - Make the design responsive
    - Add local storage to project
    - Consider reformatting displayed dates on cards using date-fns
    - Maybe add in some sort of filtering functionality to learn how that's done
